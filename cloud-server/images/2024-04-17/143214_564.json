    "Description": " The image shows a group of zebras standing together in what appears to be a dry grassland. There are four zebras prominently featured in the foreground, while several more can be seen in the background. They are standing near some trees that provide them with shade. The setting suggests a natural habitat for these animals, which is typical for savannah and grassland ecosystems found in parts of Africa. "
