    "Description": " The image shows a majestic lion standing on a rocky surface. The lion appears to be in its natural habitat, possibly a savanna or grassland, as suggested by the vegetation and open landscape in the background. There are other animals in the background, which look like hyenas due to their shape and posture. The focus is on the lion, and there's a soft-focus effect on the background, emphasizing the subject in the foreground. "
