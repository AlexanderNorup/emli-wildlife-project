    "Description": " The image shows a majestic lion standing on a rocky outcropping in what appears to be a savanna or grassland environment. The lion is looking towards the camera, and there are two hyenas lying on the ground nearby. There's also a lush green field in the background, under a blue sky with some clouds. The overall atmosphere of the image suggests it might have been taken during a safari or wildlife tour. "
